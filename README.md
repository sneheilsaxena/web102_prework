## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

Mainly just reading the documents more carefully, since I got stuck on the password for Challenge 4 for a LONG time because I didn't notice that the quotes are double quotes, and not backquotes, and I didn't try printing that in the console because I assumed I was just correct.
